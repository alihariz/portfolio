I’ve worked on projects like migrating a 10-year-old VB.NET finance tool to Google Apps Script with minimal disruption, and applying NLP to classify and summarize large volumes of customer feedback. I focus on full-stack development and applied machine learning because they let me deliver end-to-end solutions—from problem definition and implementation to documentation and handover.",
