    "summary": "I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at UTM who discovered that the best solutions come from understanding both the technical stack and the problem you're solving. During my 6-month internship at Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad, I learned this firsthand—migrating a decade-old VB.NET system to Google Apps Script while ensuring zero disruption for the Finance team. I focus on full-stack development and machine learning, not because they're trendy, but because they let me build complete solutions that people actually use. Whether it's automating complaint processing with NLP or deploying a finance app with Chart.js analytics, I care about systems that work reliably in production.",
