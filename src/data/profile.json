    "summary": "I'm in my final year studying Software Engineering at UTM. During my 6-month internship at Malaysia Airports, I got to work on real systems that actual teams depend on—like migrating a 10-year-old VB.NET app to Google Apps Script without breaking anything for Finance. That's when it clicked for me: good code isn't just about picking the right framework, it's about understanding what problem you're actually solving. I work with full-stack development and machine learning because they let me build things end-to-end. Whether it's using NLP to sort through thousands of complaints or setting up a finance tracker with live charts, I'm interested in stuff that actually ships and works when people use it.",
